        "PyTorch's *Autograd* feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as *gradients)* over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power of autograd comes from the fact that it traces your computation dynamically *at runtime,* meaning that if your model has decision branches, or loops whose lengths are not known until runtime, the computation will still be traced correctly, and you'll get correct gradients to drive learning. This, combined with the fact that your models are built in Python, offers far more flexibility than frameworks that rely on static analysis of a more rigidly-structured model for computing gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Do We Need Autograd For?\n",
        "\n",
        "In training a model, we want to minimize the loss, $L$. In the idealized case of a perfect model, that means adjusting its learning weights - that is, the adjustable parameters of the function - such that loss is zero for all inputs. In the real world, it means an iterative process of nudging the learning weights until we see that we get a tolerable loss for a wide variety of inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do we decide how far and in which direction to nudge the weights? We want to *minimize* the loss, which means making its first derivative with respect to the input equal to 0: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall, though, that the loss is not *directly* derived from the input, but a function of the model's output (which is a function of the input directly). By the chain rule of differential calculus, we have $\\frac{\\partial {L({\\vec y})}}{\\partial x}$ = $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$ = $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial M(x)}{\\partial x}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\frac{\\partial M(x)}{\\partial x}$ is where things get complex. The partial derivatives of the model's outputs with respect to its inputs, if we were to expand the expression using the chain rule again, would involve many local partial derivatives over every multiplied learning weight, every activation function, and every other mathematical transformation in the model. The full expression for each such partial derivative is the sum of the products of the local gradient of *every possible path* through the computation graph that ends with the variable whose gradient we are trying to measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, the gradients over the learning weights are of interest to us - they tell us *what direction to change each weight* to get the loss function closer to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the number of such local derivatives (each corresponding to a separate path through the model's computation graph) will tend to go up exponentially with the depth of a neural network, so does the complexity in computing them. This is where autograd comes in: It tracks the history of every computation. Every computed tensor in your PyTorch model carries a history of its input tensors and the function used to create it. Combined with the fact that PyTorch functions meant to act on tensors each have a built-in implementation for computing their own derivatives, this greatly speeds the computation of the local derivatives needed for learning.\n",
